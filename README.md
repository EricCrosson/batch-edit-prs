## Examples

Use `search` to show PRs matching your query:

```
$ batch-edit-pr "author:app/renovate assignee:me semantic-release to v22" "search"

- fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/github-actions/pull/24]
- fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/rust/pull/75]
- chore(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22  [https://github.com/semantic-release-extras/test-verified-git-commit/pull/18]
- fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/typescript/pull/18]
```

Operate on that selection with a different action:

```
$ batch-edit-pr "author:app/renovate assignee:me semantic-release to v22" "approve and merge"

✔ fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/github-actions/pull/24]
✔ fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/rust/pull/75]

✔ fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/typescript/pull/18]
