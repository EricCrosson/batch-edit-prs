```
Usage: batch-edit-prs <pattern> <action>

  <pattern>    Search string to use to identify PRs to act on
  <action>     Action to take on matching PRs. Must be one of:
                 "search", "approve", "merge", "approve and merge", "close"

```

## Examples

Use `search` to show PRs matching your query:

```
$ batch-edit-pr "author:app/renovate assignee:me semantic-release to v22" "search"

🔍 fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/github-actions/pull/24]
🔍 fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/rust/pull/75]
🔍 chore(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22  [https://github.com/semantic-release-extras/test-verified-git-commit/pull/18]
🔍 fix(deps): update dependency semantic-release to v22    [https://github.com/semantic-release-action/typescript/pull/18]
```

Operate on that selection with a different action:

```
$ batch-edit-pr "author:app/renovate assignee:me semantic-release to v22" "approve and merge"
