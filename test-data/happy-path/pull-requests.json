**node-versions:** the minimum supported version for the v20 range of node has been raised slightly to\n    v20.6.1 to avoid a known node bug\n-   **node-versions:** the minimum supported node version in the v20 major range is now v20.6\n-   **node-versions:** node v18.17 is now the minimum supported node version and support for v19 has been dropped\n-   exports prevents access to internal files, but they arent intended for public use anyway\n-   **conventional-changelog-presets:** the new preset format is a breaking change when compared to the previous preset format. updating to support the new format means that the old preset format is no longer supported. update your preset to the latest version to maintain compatibility. this is also important if you are using a preset outside of the list of official conventional-changelog presets since your preset will need to be updated to export async functions to match the expected preset signature.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n###

Source](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/compare/v21.1.2...v22.0.0)\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n-   **deps:** updated to the latest beta of the commit analyzer plugin ([03a687b](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/03a687b3ea862f06cc5f8a721827296718640fd1))\n-   **deps:** updated to the latest betas of the commit-analyzer and

supported new preset format ([07a79ea](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/07a79ea7e9588f3c4175b4c7196370819cae8a56))\n-   defined exports for the package ([72ab317](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/72ab317bb0c6333c643f457f5658c318b78e4740))\n-   **node-versions:** raised the minimum node v20 requirement to v20.6 ([e623cc6](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/e623cc642ae2a2dba0d439494ba700366bd86dd3))\n-   **node-versions:** raised the minimum required node version to v18.17 and dropped v19 support ([b9f294d](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/b9f294d179b2792882c19206b64eb484bb0c1cef))\n-   **node-versions:** raised the minimum supported node version w/in the v20 range to v20.6.1 ([b93bef4](https://togithub.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/commit/b93bef4eea9baf3a94f41def4efb2f2af19cddf6))\n\n##### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n-   **node-versions:** the minimum supported version for the v20 range of node has been raised slightly to\n    v20.6.1 to avoid a known node bug\n-   **node-versions:** the minimum supported node version in the v20 major range is now v20.6\n-   **node-versions:** node v18.17 is now the minimum supported node version and support for v19 has been dropped\n-   exports prevents access to internal files, but they arent intended for public use anyway\n-   **conventional-changelog-presets:** the new preset format is a breaking change when compared to the previous preset format. updating to support the new format means that the old preset format is no longer supported. update your preset to the latest version to maintain compatibility. this is also important if you are using a preset outside of the list of official conventional-changelog presets since your preset will need to be updated to export async functions to match the expected preset signature.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n###

**node-versions:** the minimum supported version for the v20 range of node has been raised slightly to\n    v20.6.1 to avoid a known node bug\n-   **node-versions:** the minimum supported node version in the v20 major range is now v20.6\n-   **node-versions:** node v18.17 is now the minimum supported node version and support for v19 has been dropped\n-   exports prevents access to internal files, but they arent intended for public use anyway\n-   **conventional-changelog-presets:** the new preset format is a breaking change when compared to the previous preset format. updating to support the new format means that the old preset format is no longer supported. update your preset to the latest version to maintain compatibility. this is also important if you are using a preset outside of the list of official conventional-changelog presets since your preset will need to be updated to export async functions to match the expected preset signature.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n###

**node-versions:** the minimum supported version for the v20 range of node has been raised slightly to\n    v20.6.1 to avoid a known node bug\n-   **node-versions:** the minimum supported node version in the v20 major range is now v20.6\n-   **node-versions:** node v18.17 is now the minimum supported node version and support for v19 has been dropped\n-   exports prevents access to internal files, but they arent intended for public use anyway\n-   **conventional-changelog-presets:** the new preset format is a breaking change when compared to the previous preset format. updating to support the new format means that the old preset format is no longer supported. update your preset to the latest version to maintain compatibility. this is also important if you are using a preset outside of the list of official conventional-changelog presets since your preset will need to be updated to export async functions to match the expected preset signature.\n\n###
